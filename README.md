# Vietnamese Listening Trainer (Prototype)

A small, listening-first tool to help beginners get oriented in **spoken Vietnamese**.

This project focuses on **short, natural sentences**, played with **clear Northern Vietnamese (Hà Nội) pronunciation** using high-quality text-to-speech, paired with an immediate English meaning.

There is no grammar drilling, no forced speaking, and no gamification pressure — the goal is simply to **train the ear**.

## Why this exists

When starting Vietnamese, especially as an adult, it’s easy to get lost:

- Native audio is often too fast or too long  
- Accents vary and add confusion  
- Many apps push speaking or memorization too early  
- Listening practice is rarely structured or repeatable  

This tool was built to answer a simple need:

> *“Let me listen to short Vietnamese sentences, understand what they mean, and repeat them calmly.”*

---

## Core ideas

- **Listening first**: sound → recognition → meaning  
- **Short sentences**: easy to replay, easy to focus  
- **One accent**: Northern Vietnamese (Hà Nội) for consistency  
- **No pressure**: no scores, no penalties, no output required  
- **Repeatability**: sentences can be replayed as often as needed  

This is meant to support the *early phase* of language acquisition, where building accurate sound categories matters more than speaking.

---

## How it works

- A curated set of common, natural Vietnamese sentences
- Each sentence includes:
  - Vietnamese audio (TTS)
  - English meaning
- Simple navigation to move through sentences
- Focus on attentive listening rather than testing

Future versions may include optional light interaction (e.g. recognition checks), but the first version intentionally stays minimal.

---

## Status

This is an **early, personal prototype** that already works well for its intended purpose.

It may evolve, but it is also useful as-is.

---

## Who this is for

- Absolute or early beginners in Vietnamese
- Learners who want to improve **listening comprehension**
- People exposed to Vietnamese at home or in daily life
- Anyone who prefers calm, focused learning tools

---

## Not a goal (by design)

- Teaching grammar rules
- Training pronunciation accuracy
- Full conversational practice
- Covering all accents or advanced language use

Those come later — this tool is about *orientation*, not mastery.
